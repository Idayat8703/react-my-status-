Overview

This is a job tracking application where job applicants can keep track of the different applications they've submitted, and the various actions they've taken in regards to said applications (e-mails, communications, meetings, interviews, etc.)

This app was built using ReactJS.

It uses a Rails API with a PostgreSQL database for the back end.
Signing up for an account is free, no e-mail address is needed, you don't even have to provide your name (though some of the aesthetics may suffer).
